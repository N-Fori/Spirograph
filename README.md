# Turtle Spirograph

This is a Python project that draws colorful spirographs using the Turtle graphics module.

## Features

- Uses the `turtle` module to create graphics.
- Draws a spirograph with customizable gap size between circles.
- Each circle is drawn in a random RGB color.
- Runs quickly with the turtle speed set to "fastest".
- Closes the window when clicked.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
2. Save the script to a `.py` file, for example `spirograph.py`.
3. Run the script in your terminal or IDE:

   ```bash
   python spirograph.py
   
A window will appear showing the colorful spirograph.

Click anywhere on the window to close it.

Code Overview
random_color() generates a random RGB color tuple.

draw_spirograph(size_of_gap) draws circles around a center, rotating by the specified gap angle.

Turtleâ€™s color and heading are updated on each iteration to create the spirograph effect.

Dependencies
Python standard library (turtle and random modules).
